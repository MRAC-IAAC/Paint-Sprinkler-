## MRAC01(24/25): Hardware_01 - FlowPress
Open source software, firmware and hardware has unleashed human creativity, sparking
significant impacts in the realms of production, prototyping, and innovation. It has
empowered individuals to craft IoT devices, drones, robots, and tailor them to specific
contexts.
In this seminar, we will explore how recent developments within the open source hardware
and software ecosystem have facilitated the rapid growth of sophisticated systems on a
tighter budget and with more accessible learning curves. We will also delve into the key
distinctions between open source hardware and industrial proprietary software.
Throughout this seminar, students will gain insights into the development of
hardware-related projects, encompassing the entire process from research and prototyping
to comprehensive documentation. Our primary focus will be on actuators, including various
motor types, solenoid valves, pneumatics, relays, electromagnets, and the methods to
control them using a microcontroller.

At the coursesâ€™ conclusion, skills developed include:
Programming using the Python or C# language
Using of microcontrollers
Controlling actuators such as motors, relays, etc.
Designing and fabricating an end effector tool to communicate between a robot arm and custom-made end effector
Programming synchronized actions between robot and the tool
Programming movements by a robotic arm
Arduino and laser cutting
Analysis of unpredicted results in design


## Introduction
This seminar invites students to explore making custom made spillers controlled by Arduino and a 6-axes robotic arm in order to paint spills on canvas with black acrylic paint.

## Context

Recently we have clearly observed immense changes in production, prototyping, and innovation that has been influenced by open source software, firmware and hardware. Human creativity has been empowered with individuals crafting IoT devices, drones, robots, and custom made tools for specific needs.

Building in this context, the seminar invites students to explore recent developments within the open source hardware
and software ecosystem . Hence, students will work with to explore new possibilities in creating custom made tools with Arduino in order to create their own end effector.

### Prerequisites
* Arduino
* Rhino + Grashopper

## Aim
Students will explore different ways to create spill paintings by using their own end effector with a 6-axes robotic arm. The goal is to create a painting that will use basic parameters as height, rotation, speed and pressure, in order to calculate specific ways that a custom made tool can cause a measured result. So even if there is no intent to create a spill painting with a specific construct , the goal is to put some order to the chaos by creating a painting that can be distinguised by a viewer as a result of a robotic process and not a random human made process.
